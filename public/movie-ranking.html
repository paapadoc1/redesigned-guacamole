<h3>Scarface</h3>
<p>A hood classic. Cuban immigrant starts from nothing to build a million dollar drug empire. His overindulgence in alcohol and women would eventually lead to his downfall</p>
<h3>The Downfall of Diddy</h3>
<p>Another masterpiece from the king of trolls himself, 50 cent</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer Mugen Train Arc</h3>
<p>Some animations just cannot be matched. Best animated film, I've ever seen. The artwork was just that untouchable.</p>
